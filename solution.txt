Table ``domain`` representing fully qualified domain name registrations life time. 
Besides domain name it holds timestamps when domain name was registered and unregistered (deleted). 
Records of the given domain name cannot overlap in time (there can be only one record for given domain name which has not yet been marked as unregistered).
----------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE domain(
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    domain_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
    registered_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, 
    unregistered_at TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_active ON domain(domain_name) WHERE unregistered_at IS NULL;
----------------------------------------------------

Table ``domain_flag`` should represent history of flags being enabled and disabled on domains during time. 
For simplicity we can assume that individual flags are independent on each other and records for given domain can overlap in time. 
Each flag can be valid for some period of time. It always starts at specific time but the upper limit can be unbounded which means that it is valid indefinitely. 
We never change already inserted records with one exception: if upper limit is unbounded, it can be set to specific point in time but never to the past (at the time the change is made).

----------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE domain_flag(
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    domain_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES domain(id),
    flag_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
    valid_from TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, 
    valid_until TIMESTAMP
);

ALTER TABLE domain_flag ADD CONSTRAINT valid_flag CHECK (flag_name IN ('EXPIRED','OUTZONE','DELETE_CANDIDATE'));
ALTER TABLE domain_flag ADD CONSTRAINT valid_period CHECK ((valid_until IS NULL) OR (valid_until > NOW()));
----------------------------------------------------

NOW INSERT SOME DATA:

Write a ``SELECT`` query which will return fully qualified domain name of domains which are currently (at the time query is run) registered and do not have and active (valid) expiration (``EXPIRED``) flag.
----------------------------------------------------
SELECT domain_name FROM domain
LEFT JOIN domain_flag ON domain.id = domain_flag.domain_id 
WHERE domain.unregistered_at IS NULL  
    AND NOT ((domain_flag.flag_name = 'EXPIRED' AND domain_flag.valid_until > NOW()) OR (domain_flag.flag_name = 'EXPIRED' AND domain_flag.valid_until IS NULL));
----------------------------------------------------

-- criteria to fitler. unregistered_at must be NULL
-- expired cannot be active, means if the flag is expired, then check if it is valid. Also if it is valid_from but no end. This exclude too


Write a ``SELECT`` query which will return fully qualified domain name of domains which have had active (valid) ``EXPIRED`` and ``OUTZONE`` flags 
(means both flags and not necessarily at the same time) in the past (relative to the query run time).

----------------------------------------------------
SELECT domain_name FROM domain
LEFT JOIN domain_flag ON domain.id = domain_flag.domain_id 
WHERE 
    (domain_flag.flag_name = 'EXPIRED' AND domain_flag.valid_until < NOW()) OR (domain_flag.flag_name = 'OUTZONE' AND domain_flag.valid_until < NOW());

Implement as much as you can and if you think that some part of the task cannot be implemented explain it in your solution.
----------------------------------------------------
There is not possible, to change inserted records. We can always use UPDATE TABLE and set values. But we can validate that values to be correct.
As I did, i am checking, that the valid_until is NULL or it is greater than NOW() -> cannot insert valid_until to history from NOW().
----------------------------------------------------

Propose (not necessarily implement) other possible constraints and enhancements which could be created and not have been explicitly mentioned in the task description.
----------------------------------------------------
One of constraints what i would like to add, is about validating the correctness of domain name. Domain name should not have harmful meaning, but this feature
should be primarily implementing in backend processing even before saving into DB.
Then also we can create a constraint, which will validate, that one domain has only one flag_name. Now we can have multiple same flag_name to one domain.
